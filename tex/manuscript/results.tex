\subsection{Analyses of simulated data}

Summary Statistics
Before looking at the results here are some summary statistics that we need to 
understand to interpret the results. Coverage or credible sties is the probability
of the number events within the credible sites. The probability of estimated number 
of events equal to the true number of events which basially tells us how often we 
are right. Median posterior probability is the true number of events given the data 
and this summary statistics tells us how much support we have for the correct answer.
Root mean square error quantifies how much error is there and comparing the true 
value to the estimate value. 
Hyper Parameter Estimation 
We are going to look how well the hyper parameters are estimated. Dirichlet
prior has as a single parameter called concentration parameter that tells how cluster 
the process is. The result of estimated concentration verses true concentration plot
shows that the true value is within 95% credible sites. Pitman-Yor prior has two 
parameters(concentration parameter and discount parameter) the concentration plot 
the estimated valuer verses the true value indicates that the true is also within 95%
credible sites. The Uniform prior has split weight and the result of estimated value 
verses the true values shows the true value is little less comparing to the other two 
priors but it's still within 94% credible sites.
