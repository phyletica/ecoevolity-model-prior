\subsection{Analyses of simulated data}

Summary Statistics
Before looking at the results here are some summary statistics that we need to 
understand to interpret the results. Coverage or credible sties is the probability
of the number events within the credible sites. The probability of estimated number 
of events equal to the true number of events which basicially tells us how often we 
are right. Median posterior probability is the true number of events given the data 
and this summary statistics tells us how much support we have for the correct answer.
Root mean square error quantifies how much error is there and comparing the true 
value to the estimate value. 
Hyper Parameter Estimation 
We are going to look how well the hyper parameters are estimated. Dirichlet
prior has as a single parameter called concentration parameter that tells how cluster 
the process is. The result of estimated concentration verses true concentration plot
shows that the true value is within 95% credible sites. Pitman-Yor prior has two 
parameters(concentration parameter and discount parameter) the estimated value of 
concentration verses the true value indicates that the true is also within 95%
credible sites. The Uniform prior has split weight and the result of estimated value 
verses the true value shows the true value is little less comparing to the other two 
priors but it's still within 94% credible sites.
In this study, we are interested in divergence time and sharing divergence time and 
everything else is nuisance parameters. For both divergence time and sharing divergence time 
estimation we analyzed data with constant sites and without constant sites. First, we are going 
to look at the results of divegence time estimation with constant sites. The models which generated 
the data in rows and columns represent the models under which the data is analyzed. The true divergene 
time is on x-axis and the estimated divergence time is on y-axis. The results of true divergence 
time verses estimated divengence time show that all the three models (DP, PYP, and SW) performed
equally well with very similiar coverage around 95%. Except for independent all others have truths 
contianed in within that 95% credible interval. Independent is little lower because it's evolving 
indepdently and we are not modleing that way. We haven't observed any patterns that differiate
these 3 models. Root mean square errors are very similiar across all the models as well.
