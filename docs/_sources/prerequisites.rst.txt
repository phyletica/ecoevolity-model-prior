Before starting
###############

Before diving into this project there are some skills and software that are
needed.


Required skills
===============

This project documentation assumes some basic skills using the command line and
the version-control tool, |git|_.
By "command line," we mean a Unix-like shell environment.
For this documentation, we assume you are using the Bash shell specifically.

For learning basic Bash skills, 
`Software Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/>`_
has a nice lesson:

*  http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/


For learning basic |git|_ skills, 
`Software Carpentry <https://software-carpentry.org/>`_
has a nice lesson for that as well:

*  http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/


Required software
=================

Unix-like shell environment
---------------------------

As alluded to above in the required-skills section, you will need to have
access to a Unix-like shell environment (or Unix-like "command line").
If you are not sure what this is, please try out
`this Software Carpentry lesson <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_.

Folks in the |phyleticalab|_ will be using Bash on
Auburn University's Hopper cluster.


Conda
-----

While not absolutely necessary, working on the this project will be easier if you
have some sort of conda installation, like
|Anaconda|
or
|Miniconda|.
Several Python scripts are used in this project, and we provide a conda
configuration file that allows you to easily set up a Python environment for
these scripts to work successfully.

C++ compiler
------------

This project requires |cmake|_ and a new-ish C++ compiler (one that supports
the C++11 standard). This are needed to compile |eco|_.


.. _setting-up:

Getting set up
==============

This section is intended specifically for |phyleticalab|_ members to get their
accounts on the Hopper cluster set up for working on this project.
If you are not in the lab, some of the instructions below might still be useful
for setting up your own system to work on this project.
