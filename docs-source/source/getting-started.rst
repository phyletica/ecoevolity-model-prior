If you haven't already, you should familiarize yourself with the
:ref:`prerequisites` and :ref:`background` sections of documentation.
If you are a |phyleticalab|_ member, make sure you have done everything in the
:ref:`setting-up` section. 


.. _clone-project:

Cloning the project repo
========================

Open up a terminal and navigate to where you want to work on this project.
For |phyleticalab|_, this means logging in to Hopper::

    ssh YOUR-AU-USERNAME@hopper.auburn.edu

or::

    ssh hopper

and navigating to your scratch directory::

    cd /scratch/YOUR-AU-USERNAME

Now, clone the |git|_ repository for this project::

    git clone git@github.com:phyletica/ecoevolity-model-prior.git

If this command is successful, when you::

    ls
    
you should see a directory called ``ecoevolity-model-prior`` listed.
Go ahead and ``cd`` into this directory::

    cd ecoevolity-model-prior
