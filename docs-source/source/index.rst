About
=====

This is a project of the |phyleticalab|_ to explore the behavior of newly
implemented ways of modeling shared evolutionary events and inferring such
events from comparative genomic data with the software package |eco|_.
This page documents this project for two purposes:

1. To aid members of the |phyleticalab|_ in working on this project
   collaboratively.
2. To allow anyone to follow along with the project who might be interested in
   reproducing our findings or learning how to use |eco|_.

The goal of this documentation is to convey goals and the workflow of the
project.
The ultimate arbiter of the full history and gory details of the project
is the |project_repo|_.
